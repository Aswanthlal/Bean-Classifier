## Bean Classification Project
# Overview
This project focuses on the classification of different bean types using machine learning techniques. The model is trained to classify beans into the following categories:

BARBUNYA 

BOMBAY

CALI

DERMASON

HOROZ

SEKER

SIRA

The project aims to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between different types of beans using various features related to their shape, size, and texture. The dataset used contains several instances of each bean type with detailed measurements, and the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
